# Mixins

<div class="typo-lead">
  **Sugarcss** comes with a bunch of useful mixins that you can use in your
  styles to make your life easier. You can as well make use of this system to
  create your own mixins.
</div>

## Declaring a mixin

To declare a mixin, you simply have to define it with the `@mixin` directive like so:

```css
@mixin my-mixin {
  color: red;
}
```

## Using a mixin

To use a mixin, you simply have to include it in your styles with the `@include` directive like so:

```css
.my-element {
  @include my-mixin;
}
```

## Built-in mixins

Some mixins are included by default in **Sugarcss** to help you in your daily.
Here's the list of included mixins:

- `s-destyle`: Apply the famous [destyle.css](https://nicolas-cusan.github.io/destyle.css/) reset.
- `s-reset`: Apply the famous [reset.css](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) reset with some additional things like reset the `mark` tag.
- `s-menu`: Create a simple menu icon that you can make `active` with the `s-menu-active` mixin.
